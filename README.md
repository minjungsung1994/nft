Welcome to NEAR's NFT tutorial, where we will help you parse the details around NEAR's [NEP-171 standard](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core.html) (Non-Fungible Token Standard), and show you how to build your own NFT smart contract from the ground up, improving your understanding about the NFT standard along the way.
